### What it is

RICI App is a simple, self-hosted application that allows you to run your own Run-it-Code-it events! Run it Code it is a fun event where users will try to replicate an already-created application by just interacting with it, and without viewing the source code at all! This is all done under an extremely small window of time, normally just 30-60 minutes!\

RICI App allows event organizers to easily host and judge events, while still creating an environment that makes it extremely hard to cheat! Here's how it works.
 1) First, organizers can create a RICI session with a unique ID
 2) Then, organizers can send every participant in their Discord server with a specific role their own password, which is a hash calculated from your secret key, session ID, and their Discord tag
 3) Users can log in and download the compiled application to replicate
 4) Users then submit their own replicated project within a time limit

### Installation
 1) Clone this repository, and run `npm install`
 2) Rename secrets.example.json to secrets.json
 3) Setup a Discord bot account by following [this](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot) guide
 4) Copy the bot token and replace the `discordbot` key inside of `secrets.json`
 5) Generate an invite link with admin privileges and invite the Bot to your Discord server
 6) Create a MongoDB instance and replace the `mongodb` field inside of `secrets.json` with it's connection string. It **must** include the database name of `RICIsessions` as its pathname (like below)\
 `mongodb+srv://username:pass@clusterid.mongodb.net/RICIsessions`
 7) Replace the `secret_key` field with a random string that's **secret**. (it can literally be anything)
 8) Set port as whatever port you want the server to listen on
 9) Set website_location as the place where your website will be hosted on
 10) Inside of `website.navbar`, include an array of objects describing navbar objects. (see below)\
 ```js
 {
    "title": "Hello!",
    "url": "https://my-website.com",
    "target": "_blank"
 }
 ```
 11) Now, just run `npm run start` and your RICI App will automatically spin up your Discord bot and Database connection!
